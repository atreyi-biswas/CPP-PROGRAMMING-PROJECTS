## 🧠 Related Repository – My C++ Learning Journey

If you're interested in how I learned C++ step by step — including notes, code snippets, and practice files — check out my learning repo:

🔗 [C++ Learning Journey Repository](https://github.com/atreyi-biswas/General/tree/main/cpp-programming)

> This companion repo includes concept-wise practice code, beginner-level exercises, and logical program building blocks I explored before starting these projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a collection of **independent projects** built to apply C++ in real-world contexts — outside of classroom assignments or competitive problem-solving.

Each project is:
- Designed and coded by me  
- Well-commented for clarity  
- Open to further development

## 🚧 Upcoming Projects (Planned)

- 🔐 Password Generator  
- 📊 CGPA Calculator with Ranking  
- 🗃️ Mini Student Database using Files  
- 🧮 Matrix Operations using OOP
